#The Cut Up
This program applies various cut-up techniques to create a collage from a given input file. This is very first draft, hacked together, and UGLY code. Imma gonna fix it later, but I'm checkpointing it here so that there's a history of how it's changed.

#Run It
`python2.7 -m mangler filename.mp3`
